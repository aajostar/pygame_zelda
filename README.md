# pygame zelda tutorial
[Tutorial I followed here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU1pPzEGrqw)

I don't have much to say at the moment.
I'm going to be following this tutorial as closely as possible
to just learn more about python in general. The plan is to 
practice version control and eventually add some of my own
spin on things.
